Telegram Channel API
========================

A JSON API for latest messages of public Telegram channels. 

Try it now:

- ~~Check what Durov is up to: https://t-me.vercel.app/durov~~
- ~~Check the second-latest Durov's post: https://t-me.vercel.app/durov/2~~

> **Due to abusive amount of API requests, the free demo service has been stopped. Nonetheless, you are welcome to deploy your own instance.**

Usage
-----

You can use this Web API to get the latest messages, or any one of recent 20 messages, from any public Telegram channel, anonymously.

The official demo is at `t-me.vercel.app`.

Request: `GET /:channel_username/:message_id?`

Parameters of request:
- `channel_username` (string) : the substring of the channel link after "t.me", e.g. `durov` is the `channel_username` of `t.me/durov` 
- `message_id` (integer, within [1, 20] for now, optional) : the ordinal number of the message, e.g. `1` for the latest message, `2` for the second-latest message, etc. Default is `1`.

For response format, check `https://t-me.vercel.app/durov`.
